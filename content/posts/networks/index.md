# Networks

This post is a work in progress. I am thinking through nodes within a network. I will update this as time permits. 

## Intuition

1. Every bit is important
2. A node cannot isolate from a system
3. A node must balance to the connections in their connective pool. 


## Every bit is important

Every signal is important physical information.  The signals relayed amongst the collection of individuals within a system reveals the state of the system at any given point in time.

## Adapt the environment

An individual must adapt to the signals to others within a system in order to effectively communicate.  

## Bandwidth

The bandwidth of any node within a system is limited to their capacity. Structures of nodes exist to permit the flow of information through the system.

## Networks permit communication

The structures or networks that exist within a system permit communication between nodes.

## Networks require energy to come into being

Communicaion networks are maintained by consumption of energy.

## Networks compete with other networks for energy

Information is a constrained resource. Networks compete with one another in order to acquire energy

## Networks cannot remain isolated

Networks in competition cannot isolate from one another if they share energy resources

## Networks inevitably exchange information

Nodes within networks will interact with one another 

## Sub-networks can exist within superstructures

Sub-networks with great connectivity will exist within a system
