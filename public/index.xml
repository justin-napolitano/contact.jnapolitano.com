      <description>Look at that beautiful 12 year old Honda
Why The foam holding it in place to the headliner board deteriorated. I am too broke to buy a new liner&amp;hellip; and the car is too old to make it perfect.
Find a suitable headliner replacement fabric I live in Texas and its hot. Really hot. Without some insulation the heat from the sun would bake me inside my car. I have an old quilt with some sort of poly batting that I will use for the headliner.</description>

      <description>Creating a GH Workflow to Build and Deploy a hugo site to gh-pages Why To simplify the build process.
Creating the Workflow create your yaml config file touch hugo.yaml Set the trigger and the environment defaults The code below creates a trigger on push from the main and the gh-pages branches. It also sets read and write permissions to permit executing code and building hugo.
on:# Runs on pushes targeting the default branchpush:branches:- main# - pit# - ghpages- gh-pages# Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tabworkflow_dispatch:# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pagespermissions:contents:readpages:writeid-token:write# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.</description>

      <description>Library of Congress Scraper Job This repo scrapes the library of congress for all of the US Supreme Court Cases available on their platform. I intent to use this data to create a research tool to better understand the corpus of text.
Quick History of this project I had started work on this as an undergraduate at university, but the chatbot apis were not yet available.. and training modesl were far too expensive.</description>

      <description>Creating a GCP Client Tool in Python Why I often find myself reuuing the same bits of code when working with GCP. It is very important to avoid creating multiple development trees of the same classes. I have done this before for large projects. It will lead to a very difficult to maintain stack of tools that will spaghettify over time.
Creating the submodule Create an empty directory mkdir gcpuptils Add the following code to a gcpclient.</description>

      <description>Model Design and Logistic Regression in Python I recently modeled customer churn in Julia with logistic regression model. It was interesting to be sure, but I want to extend my analysis skillset by modeling biostatistics data. In this post, I design a logistic regression model of health predictors.
Imports # load some default Python modules import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns plt.</description>

      <title>Annual Cost of Living Monte Carlo Models</title>

      <description>Cost of Living Projections Introduction I do not like negotiating for salary. Especially, without valid projections to determine a range.
I prepared this report to estimate a salary expectation that will maintain my current standard of living.
I present two Monte Carlo models of Houston and NYC annual living costs. The data is somewhat dated and &amp;ndash;particularly in the case of houston&amp;ndash; are high level estimates.
In order to produce a better report, I am currently scraping data from the internet for more accurate sample distributions.</description>

      <description>Spearman Rank in Standard Julia Well nearly, I did import the erfc function from the SpecialFunctions package. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it either. I&amp;rsquo;ll write my own soon to make up for it.
Special Thanks I came across the text Numerical Recipes in C. It was first published in 1988, by the Cambridge University Press. The authors are William H. Press, Brian P. Flannery, Saul. A. Teukolsky, and William T. Veterling.</description>

      <description>Churn Modelling Marketing Data with Julia Introduction I prepared this analysis to learn the logistic regression in Julia. The work is fairly straightforward. I am modelling if a customer will exit a website based on a number of sites. I&amp;rsquo;ll improve the model in an upcoming post. As if, is not as interesting as asking when. That will be my next project

      <description>Introduction I am currently working on a legal research series where I perform statistical analysis and ml models to legal datasets. My intention is to model the behavior of courts, determine the outcome of cases, and build a pipeline capable of identifying relevant case law by issue area.
That data set is nearly complete, but I have not decided which models to apply to it. This is where Julia comes into play.</description>

      <description>Introduction In my previous post, I demonstrated how to configure Rocky Linux and RHEL distributions for quantitative analysis.
In this post, I include a few sample programs to test your installation.
How to run the programs I saved them to a folder within the project directory.
Activate the Project using Pkg Pkg.activate(&amp;#34;.&amp;#34;) #cd(&amp;#34;&amp;lt;sub-directory-containing-files&amp;gt;) optional Run a program include(&amp;#34;path/to/script-name.jl&amp;#34;) Estimate the Value of Pi Use the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of pi.</description>
