      <description>So, I snagged my already hanging on by a thread bumper on a piece of rebar. I reversed thinking it was a small bump in the parking lot&amp;hellip; I was wrong.
Why Bumpers are expensive. I am looking at around $400.00 of bumper + paint if I try to do this on my own. Taking it to the shop&amp;hellip; yeah I won&amp;rsquo;t do that. So, rather than trying to make the prettiest beater in the car lot, I am going to make it at least a functional beater.</description>
