      <description>So, I snagged my already hanging on by a thread bumper on a piece of rebar. I reversed thinking it was a small bump in the parking lot&amp;hellip; I was wrong.
Why Bumpers are expensive. I am looking at around $400.00 of bumper + paint if I try to do this on my own. Taking it to the shop&amp;hellip; yeah I won&amp;rsquo;t do that. So, rather than trying to make the prettiest beater in the car lot, I am going to make it at least a functional beater.</description>

      <description>My beautiful 12 year old Honda has a bad headliner. It was gross. I did not like it.
Why The foam holding it in place to the headliner board deteriorated. The car is too old to make it perfect so any headliner fabric will work.
Find a suitable headliner replacement fabric I live in Texas and its hot. Really hot. Without some insulation the heat from the sun would bake me inside my car.</description>
