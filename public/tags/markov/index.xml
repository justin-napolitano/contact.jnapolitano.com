      <description>Introduction I am currently working on a legal research series where I perform statistical analysis and ml models to legal datasets. My intention is to model the behavior of courts, determine the outcome of cases, and build a pipeline capable of identifying relevant case law by issue area.
That data set is nearly complete, but I have not decided which models to apply to it. This is where Julia comes into play.</description>
