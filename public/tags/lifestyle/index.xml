      <description>Why i like to exercise. i like to over-exercise. i do not listen to my body when it needs rest. i feel as if more movement is more better.
i am getting older. i do not recover quickly.
Running when i feel stressed i run. it is a low cost way to move.
Running too far when i run, i feel a need to prove to myself that i am a runner.</description>

      <description>Why i have a bunch of random tools and pouches laying about. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it. So to feel better i want to organize a pouch that i can throw into any of my bags so that i can deal with most things i face in day to day to life.
Guiding principles  I want tools that reduce the friction in my average day to day dealings I want the pouch to be small enough to fit inside all of my bags I want the tool set to be modular so that it can be used as the base of other kits.</description>
